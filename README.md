# Hello-World

This is my first repository! I'm learning GIT

Hi, my name is Erin and I am learning GIT to expand my scope of programming languages! I currently work as a professional graphic designer and and looking to learn more about coding and web design. 

In my free time I enjoy tacos, anime, and chilling with my cat, Goku. 
Thanks for reading!

Mosey
